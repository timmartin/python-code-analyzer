This is a package of React components for analysing and visualising working Python code,
for educational purposes.

You can see a live demonstration of the components
[here](https://python-code-analyzer.aws.asymptotic.co.uk/storybook/index.html).

## Tokenizer

The tokenizer component shows the result of tokenizing Python code. The
user can edit the code and re-tokenize, to see how different code gets
interpreted by the tokenizer.

## AST visualizer

The AST visualizer will parse Python code and show the resultant parse
tree as a block diagram.
